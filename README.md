## Final Visualisation
The final visualisation on blocks: https://bl.ocks.org/MertonBoerlin/141fdf837579e2fe2c5d2da0303dbddb

## Process

This visualisation project began with a simple question: 

>How did financial markets progress during the time frame of the brexit referendum (2016-06-23) and the US election (2016-11-08)?

In order to visualise this with d3js, financial market data had to be attained from different sources. This was done using the [Quandl-Plattform](https://www.quandl.com/). Data for the daily progressions of the indexes DAX , S&P, Nasdaq, FTSE and Dow Jones were retrieved as well as the daily development of Gold price and the currency pairs USD/EUR, USD/GBP. 

Through [Data Wrangling with R](https://github.com/MertonBoerlin/EDA_Financial_Markets_Development/blob/master/Data_Wrangling.R), a single csv file was created that had info on the daily price progression of the indexes and gold through the lens of different currencies
